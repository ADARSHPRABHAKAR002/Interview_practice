System
A system is a process or collection of processes and it does certain clearly defined objectives in an apparently independent way.



Operating System
    An operating system is a set of programs, designed to manage all the resources of the computer. 
In other words, a set of programs that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware.
    Memory, I/O devices, communication devices, etc. are the hardware resources of the computer. 
File systems, virtual memory, security, etc. are software resources. Now a set of programs 
that are used to manage all these resources is called an operating system.



Functions of Operating Systems
The main functions of an operating system are as follows:
    1. Process management
    2. Memory management
    3. Secondary storage management
    4. I/O management
    5. File management
    6. Protection
    7. Networking management
    8. Command Interpretation


Four main tasks of OS
    1. Process Management
        Process creation
        Process loading
        Process execution control
        Interaction of the process with signal events
        Process monitoring
        CPU allocation
        Process termination
    2. Inter-process Communication
        Synchronization and coordination
        Deadlock detection
        Process Protection
        Data Exchange Mechanisms
    3. Memory Management
        Services for file creation, deletion, repositioning, and protection
    4. Input / Output Management
        Handles requests and releases subroutines for a variety of peripherals and read, write, and reposition programs


Types of OS
    1. Batch Processing
    2. Time Sharing
    3. Real-time Operating Systems
    4. Embedded OS
